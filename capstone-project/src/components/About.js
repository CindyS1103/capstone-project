							</h3>
							<h5>
								<strong>
									Smiles for Special Needs </strong>was founded by Joseph Hughes, who has an amazing child with intellectual and cognitive delays. When Joseph started his journey as a parent of a child with special needs, he was ill prepared for what was to follow. Over the years, he has attended countless Individual Educational Plans, (IEPs), Individual Support Plans, (ISPâ€™s), and subsequent appointments with doctors, and other professionals. Through it all he has learned that advocating for his child is paramount to seeing the successes his son has obtained. Starting an agency that provides services to individuals with special needs came out of a necessity to find compassionate and qualified providers.
